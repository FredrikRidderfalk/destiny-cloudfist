## My process

- I made the level layout using Google Sheets

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- ES6 JavaScript

### What I learned

- WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders). WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text. Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger.

### Continued development

I want to add more levels with increasing complexity.

### Useful resources

- [Pixel Art Maker](http://pixelartmaker.com/) - I made my pixel art using Pixel Art Maker.
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/) - The library used for all sound effects and game music.
